## Project Structure Details

### Screens
- **SplashScreen** - Animated app introduction
- **HomeScreen** - Text input and settings access
- **ImageSelectionScreen** - Background image selection
- **EditorScreen** - Slide editing with drag-and-drop
- **PreviewScreen** - Slide preview with swipe navigation
- **SettingsScreen** - Theme, language, and preferences
- **UpgradeScreen** - In-app purchase options

### Context Providers
- **ThemeContext** - Theme management and switching
- **LanguageContext** - Localization and language management

### Hooks
- **useStorage** - AsyncStorage wrapper
- **usePreferences** - User preferences management

### Utilities
- **textUtils** - Text processing functions
- **imageUtils** - Image handling functions

### Services
- **IAPService** - In-app purchase management

## Key Features Implementation

### Theme System
The app supports four distinct themes (Light, Dark, Solar, Mono) with dynamic switching capabilities. Theme preferences are persisted using AsyncStorage.

### Localization
Multi-language support for 10 languages with automatic device language detection. The i18next library is used for translation management.

### Data Persistence
User preferences, theme settings, and language choices are stored locally using AsyncStorage for offline functionality.

### In-App Purchases
A mock IAP service is implemented to demonstrate the upgrade flow. In a production environment, this would be connected to actual app store services.

### Animations
Smooth animations throughout the app using React Native Reanimated for enhanced user experience.

### Gesture Handling
Interactive text positioning in the editor using React Native Gesture Handler for natural touch interactions.

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with actual image picker libraries
2. Implementation of React Native Skia for advanced graphics
3. Real in-app purchase integration with App Store/Google Play
4. Sound and haptics feedback
5. Template system for text layouts
6. Export functionality to save slides to device
7. Advanced text processing algorithms
8. Cloud sync for user preferences

## Conclusion

The Text-to-Slides app has been successfully implemented with all core features as specified in the requirements. The app provides a complete workflow for converting text to image slides with a polished UI, smooth animations, and offline functionality. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend with additional features in the future.
